TypeScript is super set of JavaScript. So we can simply use if condition to do null or undefined checks.

Often people thinks that there will be a TypeScript utility function to do the job. But that’s not the case here.

If we pass null,undefined,0,false,“”,NaN values to the if condition it evaluates to false.
