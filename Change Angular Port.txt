How To Change Angular Port (ng serve port) number from 4200 to other

There are two ways we can change the default angular port number from 4200 to other number.

Using ng serve --port flag.
Specifying default port number in project’s Angular.json file.
By default Angular CLI ng serve command uses port 4200 to run the application.

** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
Using ng serve –port flag.
This is pretty simple method to change the default port number in Angular application.

While running project, with ng serve command, use --port flag followed by port number.

ng serve --port 3200
Everytime we have to pass port number to ng serve command using --port flag.

Adding default port number in project’s angular.json file.
In latest versions of Angular i.e., Angular 10+ we can configure the default port in project’s angular.json file.

Here are the steps to add default port number in Angular applications.

Navigate to project route folder.
Open “angular.json” file.
Search for “serve” configuration and it contains “options” cofig.
Add “port”:3001(or any other number) property inside options.
 "serve": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
          "options": {
            "browserTarget": "latest-angular:build",
			"port": 3001
          },
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "browserTarget": "latest-angular:build:production"
            }
          }
        }
		
Now if we run ng serve command, the project automatically uses 3001 port number specified in angular.json file.
